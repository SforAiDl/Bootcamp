This repository contains .ipynb notebooks covering the Basics of Python along with Basics of ML and DL.

The repository has been divided into several repositories -:
1.Basic Python - Contains .ipynb files covering basics of python
2.Datasets - Contains necessary datasets used in the notebooks in the repository
3.Deep Learning-Examples - Contains .ipynb files covering the basics of Deep Learning
4.Exercise - Contains some problems based on the basic Python Libraries and Basic ML
5.Machine Learning Examples - Contains .ipynb files covering the basics of Machine Learning

Solutions to the exercises and more exercise notebooks will be added as we move further.

NOTE-:The students are supposed to try the exercise after they compile the other notebooks and be a bit confident with programming in python and are familiar with the basics of Machine Learning. 

The notebooks namely-MatplotlibExercises.ipynb and NumpyExercises.ipynb have been taken from -:
